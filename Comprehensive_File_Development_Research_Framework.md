# Research Framework

- **Multi-File Analysis and Categorization**: Research systematic approaches to analyze and categorize the diverse file types in the workspace, including configuration files (.json, .yaml), web development files (.html, .css, .js, .php), documentation (.md), database schemas (.sql), and project management files to understand their current development state and expansion potential.

- **Web Radio Application Enhancement Strategies**: Investigate comprehensive development methodologies for modern web radio applications, focusing on the Radio Adamowo project files, including progressive web app optimization, media session API implementation, service worker enhancement, and user interface improvements.

- **Database and Backend Optimization Techniques**: Research advanced strategies for expanding PHP-based backend systems, database schema optimization, security implementation, rate limiting mechanisms, and comment system enhancements to maximize functionality and performance.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Development Standards**: Examine best practices for PWA implementation, manifest optimization, service worker functionality, caching strategies, and offline capabilities to ensure the web radio application reaches its full potential.

- **Security and Performance Enhancement Protocols**: Research comprehensive security measures, CSRF protection implementation, database security protocols, and performance optimization techniques to develop all security-related files to their maximum potential.

- **Documentation and Project Management Optimization**: Investigate methodologies for creating comprehensive documentation, implementation plans, research frameworks, and project tracking systems to ensure all project documentation files are fully developed.

- **Configuration and Build System Maximization**: Research advanced configuration strategies for Vite build systems, package management optimization, environment configuration, and deployment preparation to ensure all configuration files are optimally developed.
